Contact Application



Purpose:
	Using Tkinter, we built an address book app that allows users to categorize contacts using custom labels. The software will help the employer track sick time contacts   for those impacted by pandemic if an employee is affected or family member, they can still get sick time from the day of infection. Employer will then ensure employees retain their regular sick hours and only use it when they need it.


Abstract:
The software will help the employer track sick time contacts  for those impacted by pandemic if an employee is affected or family member, they can still get sick time from the day of infection. Employer will then ensure employees retain their regular sick hours and only use it when they need it Using the Tkinter module and its toolkit dependencies, we will create a multi-layer GUI that allows users to store and compartmentalize contact information into four categories.
	HR Database contact app should include:
If an employee is infected, HR will offer 9 days of Covid Sick time from the day of infection (reported date).
If an employee’s family is infected, the company will offer 7 days of covid PTO sick time to the employee.
If more than one or more employee’s family member is infected within a span of 4 days, then the employee will be awarded 5 days of covid sick time (from the most recent date when either of the family member got infected)
